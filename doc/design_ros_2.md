## Introduction

Tracing allows to record run-time data from a system, both for system data (e.g., when a process is being scheduled, or when I/O occurs) and for user-defined data.
This tool helps with user-defined trace data within the ROS 2 framework, e.g., to trace when messages arrive, when timers fire, when callbacks are being run, etc.

## Goals and requirements

### Goals

1. Provide low-overhead tools and resources for robotics software development based on ROS 2.
2. Make tracing easier to use with ROS.

### Requirements: instrumentation

Instrumentation should be built around the main uses of ROS 2, and should include relevant information:

1. Overall
    1. When creating a publisher/subscriber/service/client/etc., appropriate references should be kept in order to correlate with other tracepoints related to the same instance.
1. Publishers & subscriptions
    1. When creating a publisher/subscription:
        1. the effective topic name should be included (i.e., including namespace and after remapping).
        1. information about the publisher/subscription instances should be included, to be correlated with other tracepoints later.
    1. When publishing a message:
        1. it should be linked to its publisher.
        1. some sort of message identifier(s) should be included in the tracepoint so it can be tracked through DDS up to the subscriber's side.
            * A pointer to the message can be used to track it through the ROS abstraction layers.
            * Same for DDS, making sure to track any copies being made, if any.
            * Some logic, e.g., network packet matching or some sort of unique message identifier, can then be used to link a published message to a message received by a subscription.
1. Callbacks (subscription, service, client, timer)
    1. Callback function symbol should be included, whenever possible.
    1. Callback instances should be linked to a specific message or request, when applicable.
    1. Information about callback execution (e.g., start & end) should be available.
1. Timers
    1. Information about the period should be available.
1. Executors
    1. Information about spin cycles & periods should be available.
1. Others
    1. Provide generic tracepoints for user code.

### Requirements: analysis & visualization

Analyses process trace data.
They should be general enough to be useful for different use-cases, e.g.:

* Callback duration
* Time between callbacks (between two callback starts and/or a callback end and a start)
* Message age (as the difference between processing time and message timestamp)
* Message size
* Memory usage
* Execution time/proportion accross a process' nodes/components
* Interruptions (noting that these may be more useful as time-based metrics instead of overall statistics):
    * scheduling events during a callback
    * delay between the moment a thread becomes ready and when it's actually scheduled
    * CPU cycles

with mean, stdev, etc. when applicable.

Generic tracepoints for ROS 2 user code could be applied to a user-provided model for higher-level behaviour statistics and visualization.

### Tools/accessibility

To make tracing ROS 2 more accessible and easier to adopt, we can put effort into integrating LTTng session setup & recording into the ROS 2 launch system and command line interface.

This might include converting existing `tracetools` scripts to more flexible Python scripts, and then plugging that into the launch system and creating a `ros2cli` extension.

## Instrumentation design

This section includes information about ROS 2's design & architecture through descriptions of the main execution flows.
The instrumentation can then be built around that.

The following table summarizes the instrumentation and links to the corresponding subsections.

### General guidelines

Instrumentation points can be split into two types: initialization events and runtime events.
The former collect one-time information about the state of objects, e.g., creation of publishers, subscriptions, and services.
The latter collect information about events throughout the runtime, e.g., message publication and callback execution.
The former are therefore predominantly triggered on system initialization and are used to minimize the payload size of the latter to minimize overhead in the runtime phase.
The information that is collected to form the trace data can then be used to build a model of the execution.
Due to the very abstractional nature of the ROS 2 architecture, multiple instrumentation points are sometimes needed to gather the necessary information.
Both the instrumentation point name and the payload can be meaningful: some instrumentation points only differ by their names and are used to indicate the originating layer.

### Flow description

This subsection contains descriptions of the main execution flows using text and sequence diagrams.
These diagrams include the instrumentation points as calls to `tracetools`.
Instrumentation point calls with a question mark (`TP?()`) are not currently implemented.

Each execution flow also has a list of important information that should be collected.
These lists roughly correspond to and fulfill the [instrumentation requirements](#requirements-instrumentation) and follows the [guidelines](#general-guidelines).
All of this therefore serves as support for instrumentation design decisions.

#### Process creation

In the call to `rclcpp::init()`, a process-specific `rclcpp::Context` object is fetched and CLI arguments are parsed.
Much of the work is actually done by `rcl` through a call to `rcl_init()`.
This call processes the `rcl_context_t` handle, which is wrapped by the `Context` object.
Also, inside this call, `rcl` calls `rmw_init()` to process the `rmw` context (`rmw_context_t`) as well.
This `rmw` handle is itself part of the `rcl_context_t` handle.

This has to be done once per process, and usually at the very beginning.
The components that are then instanciated share this context.

**Important information**:
* `tracetools` version

```mermaid

    participant process
    participant rclcpp
    participant Context
    participant rcl
    participant rmw
    participant tracetools

    Note over rmw: (implementation)

    process->>rclcpp: rclcpp::init(argc, argv)
    Note over rclcpp: fetches process-specific Context object
    rclcpp->>Context: init(argc, argv)
    Note over Context: allocates rcl_context_t handle
    Context->>rcl: rcl_init(out rcl_context_t)
    Note over rcl: validates & processes rcl_context_t handle
    rcl->>rmw: rmw_init(out rmw_context_t)
    Note over rmw: validates & processes rmw_context_t handle

    rcl-->>tracetools: TP(rcl_init, rcl_context_t *, tracetools_version)
```

#### Node/component creation

In ROS 2, a process can contain multiple nodes.
These are sometimes referred to as "components."

These components are instanciated by the containing process.
They are usually classes that extend `rclcpp::Node`, so that the node initialization work is done by the parent constructor.

This parent constructor will allocate its own `rcl_node_t` handle and call `rcl_node_init()`, which will validate the node name/namespace.
`rcl` will also call `rmw_create_node()` to get the node's `rmw` handle (`rmw_node_t`).
This will be used later by publishers and subscriptions.

**Important information**:
* Link between `rcl_node_t` and `rmw_node_t` handles
* Link between node handle(s)
* Node name and node namespace

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant process
    participant Component
    participant rclcpp
    participant rcl
    participant rmw
    participant tracetools

    Note over rmw: (implementation)

    process->>Component: Component()
    Component->>rclcpp: : Node(node_name, namespace)
    Note over rclcpp: allocates rcl_node_t handle
    rclcpp->>rcl: rcl_node_init(out rcl_node_t, node_name, namespace)
    Note over rcl: validates node name/namespace
    Note over rcl: populates rcl_note_t
    rcl->>rmw: rmw_create_node(node_name, local_namespace) : rmw_node_t
    Note over rmw: creates rmw_node_t handle

    rcl-->>tracetools: TP(rcl_node_init, rcl_node_t *, rmw_node_t *, node_name, namespace)
```

#### Publisher creation

The node calls `rclcpp::create_publisher()`.
That ends up creating an `rclcpp::Publisher` object which extends `rclcpp::PublisherBase`.
The latter allocates an `rcl_publisher_t` handle, fetches the corresponding `rcl_node_t` handle, and calls `rcl_publisher_init()` in its constructor.
`rcl` does topic name expansion/remapping/validation.
It creates an `rmw_publisher_t` handle by calling `rmw_create_publisher()` of the given `rmw` implementation and associates it with the node's `rmw_node_t` handle and the publisher's `rcl_publisher_t` handle.
`rmw` associates the `rmw_publisher_t` handle with the underlying DDS object's GID.

<!-- Note: there is an optional intra-process setup step, but it might not be relevant on the publisher side. -->

**Important information**:
* Link between `rcl_publisher_t` and `rmw_publisher_t` handles
* Link to underlying DDS object's GID
* Link to corresponding node handle
* Topic name
* *Some* QoS information

    Note over rcl: populates rcl_publisher_t
    rcl->>rmw: rmw_create_publisher(rmw_node_t, topic_name, qos_options) : rmw_publisher_t
    Note over rmw: creates rmw_publisher_t handle
    Note over rmw: creates middleware objects

    rcl-->>tracetools: TP(rcl_publisher_init, rcl_node_t *, rcl_publisher_t *, rmw_publisher_t *, topic_name, depth)
```

#### Subscription creation

Subscription creation is done in a very similar manner.

The node calls `rclcpp::create_publisher()`, which ends up creating an `rclcpp::Subscription` object which extends `rclcpp::SubscriptionBase`.
The latter allocates an `rcl_subscription_t` handle, fetches its `rcl_node_t` handle, and calls `rcl_subscription_init()` in its constructor.
`rcl` does topic name expansion/remapping/validation.
It creates an `rmw_subscription_t` handle by calling `rmw_create_subscription()` of the given `rmw` implementation and associates it with the node's `rmw_node_t` handle and the subscription's `rcl_subscription_t` handle.
`rmw` associates the `rmw_subscription_t` handle with the underlying DDS object's GID.
`rclcpp::Subscription` creates an `rclcpp::AnySubscriptionCallback` object and associates it with itself.

If intra-process is enabled, `rclcpp::Subscription` also creates a `rclcpp::SubscriptionIntraProcess` object, which has its own `rclcpp::AnySubscriptionCallback` object.
See the [IntraProcessBuffer creation section](#intraprocessbuffer-creation).

**Important information**:
* Link between `rcl_subscription_t` and `rmw_subscription_t` handles and `rclcpp::Subscription` object
* Link between `rcl_subscription_t` and `rclcpp::SubscriptionIntraProcess` object
* Link to callback object(s), with callback function symbol string
* Link to underlying DDS object's GID
* Link to corresponding node handle
* Topic name
* *Some* QoS information

```mermaid

    Note over rmw: (implementation)

    node->>rclcpp: create_subscription(topic_name, callback, options, use_intra_process)
    Note over rclcpp: creates a Subscription, which extends SubscriptionBase, which allocates rcl_subscription_t handle

    rcl-->>tracetools: TP(rcl_subscription_init, rcl_node_t *, rcl_subscription_t *, rmw_subscription_t *, topic_name, depth)

    opt intra_process
        Note over rclcpp: sets up SubscriptionIntraProcess object with its callback
        rclcpp-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_subscription_callback_added, rcl_subscription_t *, rclcpp::AnySubscriptionCallback *)
        rclcpp-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_subscription_init, rcl_subscription_t *, rclcpp::SubscriptionIntraProcess *)
        rclcpp-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_callback_register, rclcpp::AnySubscriptionCallback *, symbol)
    end

    rclcpp-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_subscription_init, rcl_subscription_t *, Subscription *)
    rclcpp-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_subscription_callback_added, rcl_subscription_t *, rclcpp::AnySubscriptionCallback *)
    rclcpp-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_callback_register, rclcpp::AnySubscriptionCallback *, symbol)
```

#### IntraProcessBuffer creation

The initialization process for the buffer used in intra-process communication is performed as part of the [initialization process for the subscription](#subscription-creation).
First, the `rclcpp::SubscriptionIntraProcess` that is responsible for managing intra-process communication is created.
It then creates an instance of `rclcpp::experimental::SubscriptionIntraProcessBuffer` using the `rclcpp::experimental::create_intra_process_buffer()` function.
This function creates a `rclcpp::experimental::buffers::TypedIntraProcessBuffer` object with a `rclcpp::experimental::buffers::RingBufferImplementation`.
The initialization of intra-process communication is completed by registering the settings related to the intra-process communication generated above using `rclcpp::SubscriptionBase::setup_intra_process()`.

    Subscription --> tracetools: TP(rclcpp_subscription_callback_added, rclcpp::Subscription *, rclcpp::AnySubscriptionCallback *)
```

#### Executors

An `rclcpp::Executor` object is created for a given process.
It can be a `rclcpp::executors::SingleThreadedExecutor` or a `rclcpp::executors::MultiThreadedExecutor`, with the former currently being the default.

Nodes are instanciated, usually as a `shared_ptr` through `std::make_shared<Node>()`, then added to the executor with `rclcpp::Executor::add_node()`.

After all the nodes have been added, `rclcpp::Executor::spin()` is called (there are other spinning varations, but this is the main one).
`rclcpp::executors::SingleThreadedExecutor::spin()` simply loops forever until the process' context isn't valid anymore.
It fetches the next `rclcpp::AnyExecutable` (e.g., subscription, timer, service, client), possibly waiting a bit, and calls `rclcpp::Executor::execute_any_executable()` with it.
This then calls the relevant `execute*()` method (e.g., [`execute_timer()`](#timer-callbacks), [`execute_subscription()`](#subscription-callbacks), `execute_service()`, `execute_client()`, `Waitable::execute()`).

**Important information**:
* Timestamps of executor phases
* Link to handle of object being executed (e.g., timer, subscription)

```mermaid

    participant process
    participant Executor
    participant tracetools

    process->>Executor: Executor()
    Note over process: instanciates node
    process->>Executor: add_node(node)
    process->>Executor: spin()
    loop until shutdown
        Note over Executor: get_next_executable()
        Executor-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_executor_get_next_ready)
        Executor-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_executor_wait_for_work, timeout)
        Note over Executor: execute_any_executable()
        Note over Executor: execute_*()
        Executor-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_executor_execute, handle)
    end
```

#### Subscription callbacks

Subscriptions are handled in the `rclcpp` layer.
Callback functions are wrapped by an `rclcpp::AnySubscriptionCallback` object, which is [registered when creating the `rclcpp::Subscription` object](#subscription-creation).

In [`rclcpp::Executor::execute_subscription()`, the `rclcpp::Executor`](#executors) asks the `rclcpp::Subscription` to allocate a message though `rclcpp::SubscriptionBase::create_message()` (there are other ways to get/allocate messages, like loaning, but this is the main one).
It then calls `rcl_take*()`, which calls `rmw_take_with_info()`, which gets the message from the underlying middleware.
If that is successful, the `rclcpp::Executor` then passes that on to the subscription through `rclcpp::SubscriptionBase::handle_message()`.
This checks if it's the right type of subscription (i.e., inter vs. intra process), and then it calls `rclcpp::AnySubscriptionCallback::dispatch()` on its callback object with the message (cast to the actual type).
This calls the actual `std::function` with the right signature.

Finally, it returns the message object through `rclcpp::SubscriptionBase::return_message()`.
For simple messages without loaning, it simply gets deallocated.

**Important information**:
* Link to handle(s) of subscription being executed
* Message being taken
* Source timestamp of message being taken
* Link to callback object being dispatched, with start/end timestamps
* Whether the callback dispatching is for intra-process or not

#### Intra-process callback

Intra-process subscriptions are handled in the `rclcpp` layer.
Callback functions are wrapped by an `rclcpp::Waitable` object (i.e., the `rclcpp::SubscriptionIntraProcess` object), which is registered when creating the `rclcpp::Subscription` object.

In `rclcpp::Executor::get_next_ready_executable_from_map()`, the `rclcpp::Executor` checks for new intra-process messages.
If there is a new message, it calls `rclcpp::SubscriptionIntraProcess::take_data()`, which calls `rclcpp::IntraProcessBuffer::consume_*()` (e.g., `consume_share()`, `consume_unique()`), which in turn calls `rclcpp::BufferImplementationBase::dequeue()` to get the message from the intra-process buffer.
Then, in `rclcpp::Executor::get_next_ready_executable(any_exec)`, the executor calls `rclcpp::Waitable::execute()` with the message, which is actually `rclcpp::SubscriptionIntraProcess::execute()`.
This checks message is `shared_ptr` or `unique_ptr`, and then it calls `rclcpp::SubscriptionIntraProcess::dispatch_intra_process()`, which then calls the callback `std::function`.
Finally, the callback group (`any_exec.callback_group`) is reset.

    Note over AnySubscriptionCallback: std::function(...)
    AnySubscriptionCallback -->> tracetools: TP(callback_end, callback)
    Note over Executor: reset any_exec.callback_group
```

#### Message publishing

To publish a message, a message object is first allocated (or loaned) and then populated at the user level (e.g., in a node).
The message is then published through one of the `rclcpp::Publisher::publish()` methods.
For normal inter-process publishing, this then passes that on to `rcl`, which itself passes it to `rmw`, which passes it on to the underlying middleware.

**Important information**:
* Link to publisher handle(s)
* Message being published, with its timestamp

```mermaid

    participant Publisher
    participant rcl

    rmw-->>tracetools: TP(rmw_publish, rmw_publisher_t *, msg *, timestamp)
    Note over rmw: calls middleware
    Note over node: keeps, returns, or destroys msg
```

#### Intra-process message publishing

To publishing a message in intra-process, a message object is first allocated (or loaned) and then populated at the user level (e.g., in a node).
The message is then published through one of the `rclcpp::Publisher::publish()` methods.

For normal intra-process publishing, this then passes that on to `rclcpp::IntraProcessManager`, which itself passes it to `rclcpp::TypedIntraProcessBuffer`, which passes it on to the `rclcpp::RingBufferImplementation`.
In `rclcpp::RingBufferImplementation`, published data is stored by its `enqueue()` method.

```mermaid

    participant IntraProcessManager

    participant TypedIntraProcessBuffer

    IntraProcessManager ->> SubscriptionIntraProcess: provide_intra_process_data()
    SubscriptionIntraProcess ->> TypedIntraProcessBuffer: add_shared(message *)/add_unique(message *)
    TypedIntraProcessBuffer ->> RingBufferImplementation: enqueue()
    RingBufferImplementation -->> tracetools : TP(rclcpp_ring_buffer_enqueue, buffer *, index, size, overwritten)
```

#### Service creation

Service server creation is similar to subscription creation.
The node calls `rclcpp::create_service()` which ends up creating a `rclcpp::Service`.
In its constructor, it allocates a `rcl_service_t` handle, and then calls `rcl_service_init()`.
This processes the handle and validates the service name.
It calls `rmw_create_service()` to get the corresponding `rmw_service_t` handle.
`rclcpp::Service` creates an `rclcpp::AnySubscriptionCallback` object and associates it with itself.

**Important information**:
* Link between `rcl_service_t` and `rmw_service_t` handles
* Link to callback object, with callback function symbol string
* Link to corresponding node handle
* Service name

    Service-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_callback_register, rclcpp::AnyServiceCallback *, symbol)
```

#### Service callbacks

Service callbacks are similar to subscription callbacks.
In `rclcpp::Executor::execute_service()`, the `rclcpp::Executor` allocates request header and request objects.
It then calls `rclcpp::Service::take_type_erased_request()`, which calls `rcl_take_request()` & `rmw_take_request()`.

If those are successful and a new request is taken, then the `rclcpp::Executor` calls `rclcpp::Service::handle_request()` with the request.
This casts the request to its actual type, allocates a response object, and calls `rclcpp::AnyServiceCallback::dispatch()`, which calls the actual `std::function` with the right signature.

If there is a service response for the request, `rclcpp::Service::send_response()` is called, which calls `rcl_send_response()` & `rmw_send_response()`.

**Important information**:
* Request being taken
* Link to callback object being dispatched, with start/end timestamps
* TODO
    * Link to handle(s) of service being executed
    * Source timestamp of request being taken
    * Link between request and response

            rcl->>rmw: rmw_send_response(rmw_service_t *, request_header *, response *)
        end
    end
```

#### Client creation

Client creation is similar to publisher creation.
The node calls `rclcpp::create_client()` which ends up creating a `rclcpp::Client`.
In its constructor, it allocates a `rcl_client_t` handle, and then calls `rcl_client_init()`.
This validates and processes the handle.
It also calls `rmw_create_client()` which creates the `rmw_client_t` handle.

**Important information**:
* Link between `rcl_client_t` and `rmw_client_t` handles
* Link to corresponding node handle
* Service name

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant node
    participant Client
    participant rcl
    participant rmw

    Note over rmw: (implementation)

    node->>rclcpp: create_client(service_name, options)
    rclcpp->>Client: Client(service_name, options)
    Note over Client: allocates a rcl_client_t handle
    Client->>rcl: rcl_client_init(out rcl_client_t *, rcl_node_t *, service_name, options)
    Note over rcl: validates and processes rcl_client_t handle
    rcl->>rmw: rmw_create_client(rmw_node_t *, service_name, qos_options): rmw_client_t
    Note over rmw: creates rmw_client_t handle
    rcl-->>tracetools: TP(rcl_client_init, rcl_client_t *, rcl_node_t *, rmw_client_t *, service_name)
```

#### Client request/response

A client request has multiple steps.
The node (or the owner of the `rclcpp::Client`, at the user level) first creates a request object and populates it.
It then calls `rclcpp::Client::async_send_request()` with the request.
It can also provide a callback, but it's optional.
The `rclcpp::Client` passes that on to `rcl` by calling `rcl_send_request()`.
`rcl` generates a sequence number and assigns it to the request, then calls `rmw_send_request()`.
Once this is done, the `rclcpp::Client` puts this sequence number in an internal map along with the created promise and future objects, and the callback (which might simply be empty).

If a callback was provided when sending the request, the `rclcpp::Client` simply uses the executor to spin and lets its callback be called.
Otherwise, it uses the future object returned by `rclcpp::Client::async_send_request()`, and calls `rclcpp::spin_until_future_complete()`.
This waits until the future object is ready, or until timeout, and returns.
If this last call was successful, then the node can get the result (i.e., response) and do something with it.

**Important information**:
* TODO
    * Link to handle(s) of client
    * Request being sent, with timestamp
    * Link to callback object being used, with start/end timestamps
    * Response being taken
    * Source timestamp of response being taken
    * Link to response

            Client-->>tracetools: TP?(callback_end, rcl_client_t *)
        end
    end
```

#### Timer creation

Timer creation is similar to subscription creation.
The node calls `rclcpp::create_wall_timer()` which ends up creating a `rclcpp::WallTimer`, which extends `rclcpp::GenericTimer`, which extends `rclcpp::TimerBase`.
In its constructor, it creates a `rclcpp::Clock` object, which (for a `rclcpp::WallTimer`) is simply a nanosecond clock.
It then allocates a `rcl_timer_t` handle, and then calls `rcl_timer_init()`.
This processes the handle and validates the period.
`rclcpp::GenericTimer` has its own callback.
Also, timers are not linked to any node at the `rcl` level.
They are only linked to nodes at the `rclcpp` level in `rclcpp::create_wall_timer()`, after being created.

Note that `rcl_timer_init()` can take a callback as a parameter, but right now that feature is not used anywhere (`nullptr` is given), and callbacks are instead handled in the `rclcpp` layer.

**Important information**:
* Timer handle
* Timer period
* Link to corresponding node handle
* Link to timer callback, with symbol

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant node
    participant rclcpp
    participant WallTimer

    Note over WallTimer: creates or uses an rclcpp::Clock object
    Note over WallTimer: allocates a rcl_timer_t handle
    WallTimer->>rcl: rcl_timer_init(out rcl_timer_t *, rcl_clock_t *, rcl_context_t *, period)
    Note over rcl: validates and processes rcl_timer_t handle
    rcl-->>tracetools: TP(rcl_timer_init, rcl_timer_t *, period)
    WallTimer-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_timer_callback_added, rcl_timer_t *, callback *)
    WallTimer-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_callback_register, callback *, symbol)
    Note over rclcpp: calls NodeTimers::add_timer() after timer is created
    rclcpp-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_timer_link_node, rcl_timer_t *, rcl_node_t *)
```

#### Timer callbacks

Timer callbacks are similar to susbcription callbacks.
The executor spins until the timer is ready.
Then the `rclcpp::Executor` calls `rclcpp::Executor::execute_timer()`, which calls `rclcpp::WallTimer::execute_callback()`.
This calls the actual callback `std::function`.
Depending on the `std::function` that was given when creating the timer, it will either call the callback without any parameters or it will pass a reference of itself.

**Important information**:
* Link to handle of timer being executed
* Link to timer callback object being executed, with start/end timestamps

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant node
    participant Executor
    participant WallTimer
    participant tracetools

    node->>Executor: spin()
    Note over Executor: spins until timer is ready

    Executor-->>tracetools: TP(rclcpp_executor_execute, rcl_timer_t *)
    Note over Executor: execute_timer()
    Executor->>WallTimer: execute_callback()
    WallTimer-->>tracetools: TP(callback_start, callback *)
    Note over WallTimer: std::function(...)
    WallTimer-->>tracetools: TP(callback_end, callback *)
```

#### State machine creation

State machines are usually created when an `rclcpp::LifecycleNode` is initialized.
It calls `rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_init()`.

**Important information**:
* Link between state machine handle and node handle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant LifecycleNode
    participant rcl
    participant tracetools

    Note over LifecycleNode: initialization
    Note over LifecycleNode: allocates a rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_t handle
    LifecycleNode->>rcl: rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_init(rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_t *, rcl_node_t *)
    rcl-->>tracetools: TP(rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_init, rcl_node_t *, rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_t *)
```

#### State machine transitions

State machine transitions are usually triggered by `rclcpp::LifecycleNode::trigger_transition()`, which are themselves triggered by `rclcpp::LifecycleNode`'s various standard state transition methods.

**Important information**:
* Link to handle of state machine being state-transitioned
* Start and goal labels (i.e., current state and next state, respectively)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant LifecycleNode
    participant rcl
    participant tracetools

    Note over LifecycleNode: (...)
    Note over LifecycleNode: trigger_transition(...)
    LifecycleNode->>rcl: rcl_lifecycle_trigger_transition_by_*(rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_t *, ...)
    rcl-->>tracetools: TP(rcl_lifecycle_transition, rcl_lifecycle_state_machine_t *, start_label, goal_label)
```

## Design & implementation notes

### Targeted tools/dependencies

The targeted tools or dependencies are:

* LTTng for tracing
* pandas and Jupyter for analysis & visualization

### Design

The plan is to use LTTng with a ROS wrapper package like `tracetools` for ROS 1.
The suggested setup is:

* a tracing package (e.g., `tracetools`) wraps calls to LTTng
* ROS 2 is instrumented with calls to the tracing package, therefore it becomes a dependency and ships with the core stack
* by default, the tracing package's functions are empty -- they do not do anything
* if users want to enable tracing, they need to
    * install LTTng
    * compile the tracing package from source, setting the right compile flag(s)
    * overlay it on top of their ROS 2 installation
* use other package(s) for analysis and visualization

### Adding instrumentation

The process for adding instrumentation to the ROS 2 core and supporting it in `ros2_tracing` is as follows:

1. Add LTTng tracepoint definition to the [`tp_call.h`](../tracetools/include/tracetools/tp_call.h) file
    * tracepoint name, arguments, and fields
    * arguments and fields are usually the same
    * refer to the [LTTng documentation](https://lttng.org/docs/#doc-defining-tracepoints)
1. Add corresponding instrumentation function definition to the [`tracetools.c`](../tracetools/src/tracetools.c) file
1. Add corresponding instrumentation function declaration to the [`racetools.h`](../tracetools/include/tracetools/tracetools.h) file
1. Add/use instrumentation in ROS 2 core package(s)
    1. If the package does not already have instrumentation
        1. Add `<depend>tracetools</depend>` in the package's `package.xml`
        1. Add `find_package(tracetools REQUIRED)` in the package's `CMakeLists.txt`
        1. Add `tracetools` to the list of dependencies in `ament_target_dependencies(...)` for the right executable/library in the package's `CMakeLists.txt`
        1. Add `ament_export_dependencies(tracetools)` in the package's `CMakeLists.txt` (if applicable)
    1. In the instrumented source code file
        1. Add call to tracepoint: `TRACEPOINT(tracepoint_name, arg1, arg2);`
        1. Add an include for the main `tracetools` header: `#include "tracetools/tracetools.h"`
1. Add tracepoint name to the [list of ROS 2 events in `tracetools_trace`](../tracetools_trace/tracetools_trace/tools/names.py)
1. Add/modify test in [`test_tracetools`](../test_tracetools/test) to cover the new tracepoint

Additional considerations:

* The pull request with the necessary changes in `ros2_tracing` is usually merged first, then a new release of the `ros2_tracing` is created before merging the pull request(s) for the corresponding downstream package(s) in the ROS 2 core
* For the `ros2_tracing` PR and until the PRs for the ROS 2 core package(s) are merged, local GitHub CI may need to use the modified version(s) of the core package(s) using a `.repos` file so that end-to-end tests pass (see `test_tracetools`)
* Add support for the new instrumentation in [`tracetools_analysis`](https://github.com/ros-tracing/tracetools_analysis)
    * Along with the end-to-end tests, this is usually a good way to demonstrate how the tracing data resulting from the new instrumentation is used and how useful it is

## Architecture

![](img/tracing_architecture.png)

### Notes on client libraries

ROS 2 offers a client library written in C (`rcl`) as the base for any language-specific implementation, such as `rclcpp` and `rclpy`.
However, `rcl` is obviously fairly basic, and still does leave a fair amount of implementation work up to the client libraries.
For example, callbacks are not handled in `rcl`, and are left to the client library implementations.

This means that some instrumentation work will have to be re-done for every client library that we want to trace.
We cannot simply instrument `rcl`, nor can we only instrument the base `rmw` interface if we want to dig into that.

This effort should first focus on `rcl` and `rclcpp`.
`rclpy` could eventually be added and supported, although it is not used for the kind of applications that `ros2_tracing` targets.

### ROS 1/2 compatibility

We could look into making analyses work on both ROS 1 and ROS 2, through a common instrumentation interface (or other abstraction).

A number of existing tools or libraries could be leveraged to perform analysis on the trace data collected using `ros2_tracing` and LTTng.
This section presents a minimal analysis library architecture as a working proof-of-concept: [`tracetools_analysis`](https://github.com/ros-tracing/tracetools_analysis).

### Analysis design

Generally, for a given trace data analysis objective, the following classes are extended: `EventHandler`, `DataModel`, and `DataModelUtil`.

A user/developer can implement an `EventHandler`, which defines callbacks for specific events.
Those callbacks get called by the `Processor`, and end up putting slightly-processed data into a `DataModel`, which is a data container that uses `pandas` `DataFrame`s.

Meaningful data can be extracted from the `DataModel`.
However, a `DataModelUtil` can provide common utility functions so that users don't have to re-write them.
This meaningful output data can then be presented through a Jupyter notebook (e.g., plots) or a normal Python script (e.g., tables).

### Analysis architecture

With profiling as an example implementation:

```plantuml
@startuml

class Processor {
 +process(events)
 -_process_event(event)
 -_expand_dependencies(initial_handlers): list {static}
 -_get_handler_maps(handlers): multimap {static}
}
class DependencySolver {
 +solve(initial_dependants): list
}
DependencySolver <-- Processor

abstract class Dependant {
 +dependencies(): list {static}
}
abstract class EventHandler {
 +handler_map(): map
 +data(): DataModel
 +process(events) {static}
}
class ProfileHandler {
 +_handle_sched_switch(event, metadata)
 +_handle_function_entry(event, metadata)
 +_handle_function_exit(event, metadata)
}
Dependant <|-- EventHandler
EventHandler <|-- ProfileHandler
Processor o-- EventHandler

abstract class DataModel {
 +print_data() {abstract}
}
class ProfileDataModel {
 +times: DataFrame
 +add_duration(tid, depth, name, timestamp, duration)
}
DataModel <|-- ProfileDataModel
ProfileDataModel o-- ProfileHandler

abstract class DataModelUtil {
 +print_data(): DataModel
 +convert_time_columns(df, columns): df {static}
}
class ProfileDataModelUtil {
 +get_tids(): list
 +get_function_duration_data(tid): DataFrames
}
DataModelUtil <|-- ProfileDataModelUtil
DataModelUtil o-- DataModel

class Notebook {
}
Notebook --> ProfileHandler
Notebook --> ProfileDataModelUtil
Notebook --> Processor
